��# recipes

We used Python 3 for our project.

Before running, you will need to make sure you have nltk installed.

To run the code that will display the transformations, run recipe_transformations.py, at which point you will be prompted to enter the type of transformation you want, as well as the url you want to transform.

Note: We did not realize while we were working that we were meant to be listing the names of contributors in commit messages. However, for the most part, we each worked on separate branches to differentiate who did what. All changes to makeHealthy.py and toolsList.py (branches 'make_healthy' and 'tools') were done by Sam Doty, Meg Grasse worked in master but wrote the code in make_vegetarian.py, Sarah Ahmad wrote most of the code in southAsian.py, parser.py, recipe_scraper.py, and recipe_transformations.py (her primary branch was south_asian, but she also made a fair number of commits in master), and Qianying Yu wrote in parser.py, ingredients.py and ingredient_analysis.py.
We also want to note that many last minute commits were made by Sarah Ahmad that made minor changes due to some issues with her git bash terminal. She wanted it to be clear that this last flurry of commits should in no way indicate that the others put in any less work.
